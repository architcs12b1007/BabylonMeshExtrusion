1. Set up a basic Babylon.js project environment.

2. Create a cube mesh object in the scene.

3. Implement the following extrusion features:

   a. User Input: Allow user to select a face to be extruded with the first mouse click, on the second click the extrusion operation should be complete and the original mesh modified.

   b. Extrusion Animation: When the user triggers the extrusion action, smoothly animate the cube's vertices to create the extrusion effect.

4. Implement additional features such as resetting the cube enhance the user experience.
